        <h3>breed history</h3>
        <p>
          The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been
          bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep.The breed was used by
          the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded
          soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the
          First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the
          population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon,
          Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
