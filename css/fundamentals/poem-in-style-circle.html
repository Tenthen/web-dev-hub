          “Hope” is the thing with feathers
          That perches in the soul,
          And sings the tune without the words,
          And never stops at all,
        </p>
        <p class="poem__para">
          And sweetest in the Gale is heard;
          And sore must be the storm
          That could abash the little bird
          That kept so many warm.
        </p>
        <p class="poem__para">
          I’ve heard it in the chillest land,
          And on the strangest sea;
          Yet, never, in extremity,
          It asked a crumb of me.
