            "Hope” is the thing with feathers <br>
            That perches in the soul, <br>
            And sings the tune without the words, <br>
            And never stops at all,
        </p>
        <p class="poem_para">
            And sweetest in the Gale is heard; <br>
            And sore must be the storm <br>
            That could abash the little bird <br>
            That kept so many warm.
        </p>
        <p class="poem__para">
            I’ve heard it in the chillest land, <br>
            And on the strangest sea; <br>
            Yet, never, in extremity, <br>
            It asked a crumb of me.
